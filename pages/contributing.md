## Contributing to CASM

CASM is updated frequently with support for new effective Hamiltonians, new interfaces for first-principles electronic structure codes, and new Monte Carlo methods. Collaboration is welcome and new features can be incorporated by forking the [repository](https://www.github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode) on GitHub, creating a new feature, and submitting pull requests. If you are interested in developing features that involve a significant time investment we encourage you to first contact the CASM development team at <casm-developers@lists.engr.ucsb.edu>.

CASM is currently beta software with very active development. Our goal is that the ``casm`` program interface, including file input and output formats, is mostly stable and backwards compatiblity will be taken into account as new features are added (though some breaking changes may occur as we learn from experience). The CASM C++ library is less stable and we expect it will continue to have significant changes in the near future.
