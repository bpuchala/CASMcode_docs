The CASM project directory structure standardizes the location of various files used by multiple CASM methods. In the descriptions that follow some paths include codes of the form `<variable>` to indicate that there may be multiple directories with varying names. This is used to i) store data for different configurations by supercell name (`<supercellname>`) or configuration name (`<configname>`) or ii) organize parallel sets of data in parallel directories to make it easy to compare and use different parameters. In particular, a CASM project tracks:
- `<property>`: the property being expanded
- `<bset>`: the choice of basis set
- `<calctype>`: the choice of property calculation method and parameters
- `<ref>`: the choice of reference states (for formation energy calculations)
- `<eci>`: the choice of fitting coefficients (effective cluster interactions)

When a CASM project is initialized with `casm init`, default directories are created with names such as `bset.default`, `calctype.default`, etc. Either manually or by using `casm settings`, the user may create new directories with custom names such as `bset.occupation`, `bset.chebychev`, `calctype.gga`, `calctype.lda`, etc. to store different choices of basis set, calculation type, etc. These directory names must be prefixed with `"bset."`, `"calctype."`, etc. for CASM to recognize them.


The CASM project settings (which can be inspected and modified by `casm settings`) store a list of named cluster expansions as described by one each of `<property>`, `<bset>`, `<calctype>`, `<ref>`, and `<eci>`. A default cluster expansion can be configured which indicates which data from which directories to query by default.

Additional `<variable>` descriptions:
- `<root>`: indicates the CASM project root directory
- `<title>`: a CASM project is given a `title` in the `prim.json` file used to initialize it
- `<dof_key>`: name of degrees of freedom (DoF) listed in `prim.json`

#### Calculation settings directories <a name="calc-settings-dir"></a>

Location:

- For default settings: `<root>/training_data/settings/<calctype>/`

Description:

Calculation wrappers for CASM (ex. `casm.vaspwrapper` for running VASP calculations, `casm.qewrapper` for running Quantum Espresso calculations) check for input settings files in the calculation settings directories, using the most local settings for a particular configuration. In most cases, the default settings files are stored in `<root>/training_data/settings/<calctype>/` and used for all configurations. Sometimes it is necessary to provide configuration specific settings to overcome an issue that arises when calculating properties. Rarely, the superell specific settings may be used to set default settings for all configurations in a particular supercell. The implementation is controlled by the wrapper code, but by convention, settings files should be searched on a file-by-file basis, so to set supercell or configuration specific settings it is sufficient to only include the particular files necessary in the supercell or configuration level settings folder.
