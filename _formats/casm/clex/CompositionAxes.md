### Description

Contains a dictionary of possible composition axes, and which one is currently selected for use in the CASM project.


#### Project files

This format is used for the [`composition_axes.json`][] file, which is generated by the `casm composition` method.


### JSON Attributes List

Project Composition Axes attributes:

| Name | Description | Format |
|-|-|-|
| [`current_axes`](#current-axes) | Identifier of the currently selected composition axes | string |
| [`enumerated`](#enumerated) | Identifiers of composition axes generated by `casm composition --calc` | array of string |
| [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) | Dictionary of possible composition axes | dict of [Composition Axes](#composition-axes-json-object) |

### JSON Attributes Description

#### Project Composition Axes JSON object

- {: #current-axes } `current_axes`: string

   Identifier of the currently selected composition axes.

   This is the key in the [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) dictionary of the composition axes currently being used by the CASM project. The current axes may be selected by `casm composition --select`.

- {: #enumerated } `enumerated`: array of string

  Identifiers of composition axes generated by `casm composition --calc`. This is a set of keys in the [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) dictionary.

- {: #possible-axes } `possible_axes`: dict of [Composition Axes]

  A dictionary where the values are possible [Composition Axes], and the keys are identifiers. Standard axes are generated by `casm composition --calc` and a user may also add custom axes manually.


#### Composition Axes JSON Object

Composition Axes holds the set of compositions, as species fraction, that are used as the origin and end members of axes defining a composition space.

- {: #end-member } `<end_member>`: array of number

  Composition of the end members of the axes defining the composition space. The `independent_compositions` value is read first to determine how many end members exist. Then, that many end member compositions are read from the attributes `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.

  The elements of the arrays are the composition of the occupant species in the corresponding element of the `components` array.

- {: #components } `components` array of string

  The names of occupants, defining the order that occupant species compositions appear in the `<end_member>` and `origin` arrays.

  The order is deterministically generated based on the order of sites and occupants in the [prim] for standard axes generated by `casm composition --calc`. Manually created composition axes should use the same order.

- {: #independent-compositions } `independent_compositions`: int

  The number of independent composition axes. Determines the number of `<end_members>`.

- {: #mol-formula } `mol_formula`: str

  A formula for the species composition in terms of composition axes coordinate.

  For manually created axes, this is generated when the `composition_axes.json` file is re-written after the current axes are selected by `casm composition --select`.

- {: #origin } `origin`: 2d array of number

  The composition at the origin of the composition axes.

  The elements of the arrays are the composition of the occupant species in the corresponding element of the `components` array.

- {: #param-formula } `param_formula`: str

  A formula for the composition axes coordinate in terms of the species composition.

  For manually created axes, this is generated when the `composition_axes.json` file is re-written after the current axes are selected by `casm composition --select`.
