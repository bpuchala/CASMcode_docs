### Description

Contains a dictionary of possible composition axes, and which one is currently selected for use in the CASM project.


#### Project files

This format is used for the [`composition_axes.json`][] file, which is generated by the `casm composition` method.


### JSON Attributes List

Project Composition Axes attributes:

| Name | Description | Format |
|-|-|-|
| [`current_axes`](#current-axes) | Identifier of the currently selected composition axes | string |
| [`enumerated`](#enumerated) | Identifiers of composition axes generated by `casm composition --calc` | array of string |
| [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) | Dictionary of possible composition axes | dict of [Composition Axes](#composition-axes-json-object) |

Composition Axes attributes:

| Name | Description | Format |
|-|-|-|
| [`<end_member>`](#end-member) | Composition of axes end members | 2d array of number |
| [`components`](#components) | Names of occupants | array of string |
| [`independent_compositions`](#independent-compositions) | Number of independent composition axes | int |
| [`mol_formula`](#mol-formula) | Species composition, in terms of composition axes coordinate | str |
| [`origin`](#origin) | Composition of axes origin | 2d array of number |

### JSON Attributes Description

#### Project Composition Axes JSON object

- {: #current-axes } `current_axes`: string

   Identifier of the currently selected composition axes.

   This is the key in the [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) dictionary of the composition axes currently being used by the CASM project. The current axes may be selected by `casm composition --select`.

- {: #enumerated } `enumerated`: array of string

  Identifiers of composition axes generated by `casm composition --calc`. This is a set of keys in the [`possible_axes`](#possible-axes) dictionary

- {: #possible-axes } `possible_axes`: dict of [Composition Axes]

  A dictionary of possible [Composition Axes]. Axes may be generated by `casm composition --calc` or added manually.
