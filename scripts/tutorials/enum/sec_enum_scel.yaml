      In CASM, crystal states consistent with the primitive crystal structure are called "configurations". Each configuration can be represented by specifying:

      - supercell vectors used to repeat a unit cell into the infinite crystal
      - the value of local degrees of freedom at each site in the unit cell, including:
        - discrete site DoF (atom or molecule site occupant)
        - continuous site DoF (ex: displacement vector)
      - the value of global degrees of freedom (ex: strain)

      Each CASM project contains a database of enumerated supercells and configurations, which may have been generated in a variety of different ways. The primary approach is to enumerate them directly using methods accessed via the `` `casm enum` `` subcommand.

      From within a CASM project, the list of enumeration methods can be printed using `` `casm enum -h` ``.

    cmd:
      - "casm enum -h"

      A common approach is to first enumerate symmetrically unique supercells and then enumerate configurations within a supercell.

      A supercell can be represented by a transformation matrix, `T`:

        `S = P * T `,

      where `S` is a 3x3 column vector matrix containing the supercell lattice vectors, and `P` is a 3x3 column vector matrix containting the primitive cell lattice vectors.
