  desc: 'CASM generates a `` `LOG` `` file which records the steps performed while
    working on your project. The `` `LOG` `` file is not a 100% complete record. It
    is limited to logging particular subcommands and does not include other subcommands,
    such as `` `casm calc` `` or `` `casm learn` ``. Also, it does not record the
    values of input files at the time they were used. Despite being an incomplete
    record, it can still be a useful tool to remember actions taken in the CASM project.
