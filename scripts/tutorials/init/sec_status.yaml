      The `` `casm status` `` command is very useful for getting information about the current status of a project. The `` `-n` `` option also gives suggestions for the next steps that you might take for the workflow of a typical CASM project. At this point, the command just indicates that no project has been initialized.
    cmd:
      - "casm status -n"
