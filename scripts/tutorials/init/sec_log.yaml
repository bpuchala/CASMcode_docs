      CASM generates a `` `LOG` `` file which records the steps performed while working on your project. The `` `LOG` `` file is not a 100% complete record. It is limited to logging particular subcommands and does not include other subcommands, such as `` `casm calc` `` or `` `casm learn` ``. Also, it does not record the values of input files at the time they were used. Despite being an incomplete record, it can still be a useful tool to remember actions taken in the CASM project.
    cmd:
      - "grep casm LOG"
