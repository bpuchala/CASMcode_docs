Note that after selecting composition axes, several conversion formulas are printed:
- number per unit cell (`` `comp_n` ``) to parametric composition (`` `comp` ``)
- parametric composition (`` `comp` ``) to number per unit cell (`` `comp_n` ``)
- standard chemical potentials (`` `chem_pot` ``) to parametric chemical potentials (`` `param_chem_pot` ``)

For details, see [Parametric Composition]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/definitions/CASM_param_comp.pdf). These will also be displayed subsequently by `` `casm composition -d` ``:
